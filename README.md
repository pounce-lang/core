# Pounce-lang/core
Pounce is a small concatenative language that runs in Javascript.
The core of the language includes a parser called "pinna" and an interpreter called "purr". A core dictionary of Pounce words is included, but can be overridden with a custom, perhaps more efficient, dictionary of words.
